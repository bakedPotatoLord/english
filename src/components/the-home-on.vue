    <h3>The Home On 135th pl</h3>
    <p>
      Half the time, I live in a house on 135th pl. I live in the house with four siblings and my two parents. It is very open, such that one could yell in the basement, and it could be heard on the second floor. The house has many rooms. The entryway has a tiled floor and a large rug that is always covered in white dog hair, as if a snowstorm had blown in. It seems like I vacuum it every week, but the fur always returns. Moving into the great room, it has a wood floor that my dog is scared to walk on. The walls are black and white, but they are highlighted by pictures of old Denver, pictures that open a doorway into the past like a flat time machine. There is a picture of Teddy Roosevelt smiling for a camera in a parade, there is a picture of Union Station, with its signature arch, and circular design. There is even a picture of a colossal snow that eats up the ground, like a great, white monster. In the center of the house there is a carpeted stairway. My dog loves to lay lazily on the midway point of the stairway, and observe what goes on around her, without having to move around. The basement of my house was recently built by my step-dad and I. We bought the house from a line of interesting owners, the most recent of which had been growing cannabis in the basement. It took more than a year to change out the moldy drywall, and to (somewhat) finish the basement. We trained to lay carpet. “That's so slay”, we exclaimed. In the front of our house, we have a tree that gracefully waves its arms in the wind.This is my house.
