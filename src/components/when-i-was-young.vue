    <h3>When I Was Young</h3>
    <p>
      When I was young, I went to summer camp for the first time. I went to camp Tahosa, which is just north of Ward, Colorado. The first day, it was raining cats and dogs. Most of our gear was drenched, but we still had to set up our tents in the torrential downpour. Tents have a rain-fly that covers the top of them, and deflects precipitation, but they do not come fully set up on their own. Even with my raincoat, I was somehow still drenched to my base-layers. Regardless, I pushed on. Me and my tent-mate, Oliver, set up our tent with speed like a cheetah's. We raced around it, extending poles and sticking them through the clips. The tent popped up like a frog, and we pulled the rain-fly over it, but we hadn’t been fast enough. The tent was full of water.

      However, at that moment of deep sadness, I found a momentary joy. “The towel,” I exclaimed. Remembering the towel in my Duffel bag. Praying that it hadn’t gotten drenched, I unzipped my bag slowly. Sure enough, it was still dry. Praising God, I ran to my tent, and sopped up the water from my tent’s soggy floor. After me and my tent-mate had set up our areas, we walked down the path to the dining hall. The ground was a river beneath our feet, as we slipped down the gravel path, our dim headlamps lighting the way.

      We burst through the door, still dripping, but immediately surrounded by warmth, and the smell of something delicious wafting from the buffet line. My boots squelching, I sauntered to the line, and was thrilled to see that the cook had made pies from marshmallow fluff and whole Oreo cookies. I scooped a healthy portion onto my plate and joined the songs. I was at camp.
